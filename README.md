## 1. Motivation & Aim of our project
This project aims to create a simple but accurate stimulation that would enable one to vizualize the phases of the moon from an observer on Earth. As a part of this python pratical, our main motivation was to challenge ourselves and learn to code by collaborating to create something interesting and with a scientific relevance.

In our stimulation, we want to visualize the dynamic between three very familiar bodies: the Earth, the Sun and the Moon. In order to do so, we created four classes: celestial bodies, orbits, observer and user interface (abbreviated as UI). The goal is to provide a user with a user-friendly interface that they could use to visualize the phases of the moon/if the moon is visible or not from a changeable location (latitude, longitude) on Earth. The observer is represented by a cat on Earth that can either be dead or alive (little nerdy quantum add to this astronomy project.)

## 2. Physics background

In astronomy, planets orbit stars and moons orbit planets due to **gravitational force**. Newton's law of universal gravitation describes the force between two objects as being:

**F = G × (m₁ × m₂) / r²**

Where:
- **F** = gravitational force (in Newtons)
- **G** = gravitational constant = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/ (in kg·s²)
- **m₁, m₂** = masses of the two objects (in kg)
- **r** = distance between centers of the two objects (in meters)

This formula is used to compute the orbits of the Earth around the Sun and the Moon around the Earth (as a basis for our simulation).

## 3. Data & libraries used
Data From where? 

Source?

In order to create this simulation, we used rebound (description of it?) as well as tkinter (for ui description?), matplotlib?...
