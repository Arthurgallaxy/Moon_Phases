# Moon Phases

Simulation of the phases of the moon as a group project for the Practical *Python Programming Language: Introduction to OOP* at MSP.

## Aim of the project
This project aims to create a simple but accurate stimulation that would enable one to vizualize the phases of the moon from an observer on Earth. 
## Physics background

In astronomy, planets orbit stars and moons orbit planets due to **gravitational force**. Newton's law of universal gravitation describes the force between two objects as being:

**F = G × (m₁ × m₂) / r²**

Where:
- **F** = gravitational force (in Newtons)
- **G** = gravitational constant = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/ (in kg·s²)
- **m₁, m₂** = masses of the two objects (in kg)
- **r** = distance between centers of the two objects (in meters)

In our stimulation, we want to visualize the dynamic between three very familiar bodies: the Earth, the Sun and the Moon. In order to do so, we created four classes: celestial bodies, orbits, observer and user interface (abbreviated as UI). The goal is to provide a user with a user-friendly interface that they could use to visualize the phases of the moon/if the moon is visible or not from a changeable location (latitude, longitude) on Earth.
